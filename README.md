# WP2 Notebooks - ObsSea4clim

This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks in the `notebook` folder, related to in-situ statistics and density analysis for the OBSSEA4CLIM project.  

Since GitHub cannot render the notebooks directly, you can view and execute them using [Binder](https://mybinder.org), which launches an interactive environment in your browser.

## Notebooks

To see and execute the notebooks, please follow the links below:

- **In_Situ_Stats_OBSSEA4CLIM.ipynb**: [Open in Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ObsSea4clim/WP2/main?urlpath=%2Fdoc%2Ftree%2Fnotebook%2FIn_Situ_Stats_OBSSEA4CLIM.ipynb)  
- **ObsSea4ClimDensity.ipynb**: [Open in Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ObsSea4clim/WP2/main?urlpath=%2Fdoc%2Ftree%2Fnotebook%2FObsSea4ClimDensity.ipynb)

## How to Use

1. Click the Binder link corresponding to the notebook you want to explore.
2. Wait for Binder to launch the interactive environment (may take a few minutes).
3. You can now run the code
